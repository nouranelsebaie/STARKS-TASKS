foo(513, 2)
= (513 % 2) + foo(513/2, 2)
= 1 + foo(256, 2)

foo(256, 2)
= (256 % 2) + foo(256/2, 2)
= 0 + foo(128, 2)

foo(128, 2)
= (128 % 2) + foo(128/2, 2)
= 0 + foo(64, 2)

...

foo(2, 2)
= (2 % 2) + foo(2/2, 2)
= 0 + foo(1, 2)

foo(1, 2)
= (1 % 2) + foo(1/2, 2)
= 1 + foo(0, 2)

foo(0, 2)
= 0


So, the return value of foo(513, 2) is 1.

Therefore, when called as foo(513, 2), the foo function will return 1.
